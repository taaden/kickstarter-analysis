# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns data with Excel 

## Overview of Project:-
  The purpose of the project is to find the trend from the data the effect of Launch date on the theater campaigns outcomes and to discover the effect that the campaigns    finnacial goal have on the campaigns outcomes.
### Analysis and Challenges:
      The analysis was done with Excel entails:
	  * Pivot table filtered on "Parent Categeory" and "Years"
	  *"Outcomes Based on Goals" sheet
	  * 2 chart images![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64270455/182556710-55ba3cdb-fd7a-4de2-8b7f-d32ad2fdf121.png)

#### Challenges:
      * Limitation of the data, the number data available on "Theater" and "play" are small to make a generalization of our findings.
	  * Analysis was done within a tight shedule,but i am very that we can help.
### Results
#### Conclusions from "Theater Outcomes by Launch Data"
    * We  can conclude that  61% of the "Theater Campaigns" was successful.
	* The trends also showed that the best time to launch the "theater" campaigns is May and June.
#### Conclusion from "Outcomes based on Goal"
    * Plays with "Goals" less than $5000  were very successful (73-76%)
#### Summary of Limitations and Recommendations
    * Amount of data on the "Theater" and "Play" is too small to make serious generalization, the more the data the better.
    * I recommend analysing the "Theater outcomes" by "Average donations" using a line chart to see how Average donations affect the Theater outcomes, since now we know that huge goals does not translate to successful outcome.
